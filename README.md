# Introduction

ICN addresses the infrastructure orchestration needed to bring up a
site using baremetal servers. It strives to automate the process of
installing a jump server (Local Controller) to the greatest degree
possible â€“ "zero touch installation". Once the jump server is booted
and the compute cluster-specific values are provided, the controller
begins to inspect and provision the baremetal servers until the
cluster is entirely configured.
